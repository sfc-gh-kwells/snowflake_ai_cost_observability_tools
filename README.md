# Snowflake AI Cost Toolkit

A collection of utilities for analyzing Cortex Analyst logs and costs in Snowflake.

## Overview

This toolkit provides functions to:
- Fetch semantic model paths from Snowflake agents
- Retrieve and analyze Cortex Analyst logs
- Calculate query latency statistics
- Analyze user activity and costs
- Join Cortex Analyst logs with query attribution data

## Installation

### Prerequisites
This toolkit is designed to run within Snowflake environments (Snowpark notebooks, Streamlit apps, etc.) where the following dependencies are available:
- `pandas`
- `snowflake.snowpark`

### Setup

#### Option 1: Git Integration (Recommended for Production)
1. **Run the Git integration setup** to deploy directly from GitHub:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the git_integration_setup.sql script in your Snowflake environment
   -- This creates Git repository integration and deploys the Streamlit app
   ```
2. **Access the deployed Streamlit dashboard** in Snowsight > Apps > Streamlit
3. **Create notebook from repository** using the Git-integrated setup_and_populate.ipynb

#### Option 2: Snowflake Notebook (Recommended for Development)
1. **Upload the notebook** `setup_and_populate.ipynb` to your Snowflake account
2. **Run all cells** in the notebook to:
   - Create database schema (tables, views, procedures) - only if they don't exist
   - Automatically discover and populate Cortex Analyst logs - skips existing data
   - Verify the setup with sample queries
   - **Cost-efficient**: Avoids expensive table recreation and duplicate data processing

#### Option 3: Manual Setup
1. **Run the SQL setup script** to create the necessary database objects:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the setup.sql script in your Snowflake environment
   -- This creates tables, views, and stored procedures
   ```

2. **Manually populate data** using the utility functions in a Python environment

)

# Get active Snowpark session
from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
session = get_active_session()

# Fetch semantic model paths
semantic_models = fetch_semantic_model_paths(session)

# Get logs for a specific semantic model
logs_df = get_cortex_analyst_logs(session, semantic_model_file_path)

# Analyze the logs
latency_stats = latency_summary_by_semantic_model(logs_df)
user_activity = user_activity_by_semantic_model(logs_df)

# Join with query history for cost analysis
ca_query_history = create_cortex_analyst_query_history(session, logs_df)

# Calculate total costs by semantic model
total_costs = total_cost_by_semantic_model(ca_query_history)
cost_breakdown = cost_breakdown_by_semantic_model(ca_query_history)

# Use LLM Usage Dashboard functions for broader AI cost analysis
import datetime
start_date = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=30)
end_date = datetime.datetime.now()

# Get AI Services overview
ai_total = get_ai_services_total_credits(session, start_date, end_date)
llm_summary = get_llm_inference_summary(session, start_date, end_date)
ca_summary = get_cortex_analyst_summary(session, start_date, end_date)

# Get detailed breakdowns
credits_by_model = get_credits_by_model(session, start_date, end_date)
credits_by_warehouse = get_credits_by_warehouse(session, start_date, end_date)
```

## Streamlit Dashboard Deployment

### Deploy in Snowflake
To deploy the Streamlit dashboard in your Snowflake account:

1. **Run the setup script** to create all necessary database objects
2. **Upload the files** to a Snowflake stage:
   ```sql
   -- Create a stage for your Streamlit app
   CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS CORTEX_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.STREAMLIT_STAGE;
   
   -- Upload the files using SnowSQL or Snowsight
   PUT file://streamlit_app.py @CORTEX_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.STREAMLIT_STAGE;
   PUT file://utils.py @CORTEX_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.STREAMLIT_STAGE;
   PUT file://environment.yml @CORTEX_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.STREAMLIT_STAGE;
   ```

3. **Create the Streamlit app**:
   ```sql
   CREATE STREAMLIT CORTEX_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.AI_COST_TOOLKIT_DASHBOARD
   ROOT_LOCATION = '@CORTEX_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.STREAMLIT_STAGE'
   MAIN_FILE = 'streamlit_app.py'
   QUERY_WAREHOUSE = 'YOUR_WAREHOUSE_NAME';
   ```

- **Tiered alerting** - Different thresholds for warnings vs critical alerts

### Quick Setup
1. **Create notification integration** (Slack or Email):
   ```sql
   CREATE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION MY_SLACK_ALERTS
     TYPE=SLACK
     SLACK_URL='YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL'
     ENABLED=TRUE;
   ```

2. **Test the alert system**:
   ```sql
   CALL AI_SERVICES_BUDGET_ALERT('MONTH', 1000, 'MY_SLACK_ALERTS');
   ```

3. **Set up automated monitoring**:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE TASK AI_BUDGET_MONITOR
   WAREHOUSE = 'YOUR_WAREHOUSE'
   SCHEDULE = '1 hour'
   AS
   CALL AI_SERVICES_BUDGET_ALERT('MONTH', 5000, 'MY_SLACK_ALERTS');
   
   ALTER TASK AI_BUDGET_MONITOR RESUME;
   ```

### Available Procedures
- **`AI_SERVICES_BUDGET_ALERT()`** - Comprehensive monitoring across all AI services
- **`MINI_BUDGET_ON_CORTEX()`** - Cortex Functions specific monitoring (compatible with existing implementations)
